### Concept
The Player is a fox that needs to travel through a neighbourhood and find as much food as possible to feed their cubs waiting back at the den, they are given free reign over their experience and the game ends when they return to the den – where they receive different endings equal to the food they collected. As the game is Puzzle based, the player cannot fight enemies and must find ways to get around enemies/clear platforming challenges to obtain food, of which can be eaten to heal after attacks – at the decrease of their point total.

### Controls
- Move: **WASD or Arrow Keys**
- Sneak: **Move** + **Shift**
- Jump: **Space**
- Inventory Open/Close: **E**
- Pause Ment Open/Close: **P**

## Instructions
In the game, there are a total of 5 Areas Players can explore and interact with:
**Main Scene:** The Area the player begins in, this also acts as an intermediary between the 4 other Exploration Acenes, as a ‘home’ Area which also includes food items to be found.
**Village Scene:** An Area consisting of a few wooden huts, a small forest and an iced-over pond. Players can explore the outside areas and avoid the enemies, or they could venture into the houses and clear platforming challenges to find food.
**Park Scene:** A Large Park Scene with many sub-areas to explore and find food. From a play area to a camp, to a sledding zone, there are many places where food can be found – alongside enemies.
**Indoor Scene:** The inside of an apartment that the Player has snuck into. A mostly platforming-based Area, Players must look closely at their surroundings to find food hidden around the apartment.
**Maze Scene:** A procedurally-generated, unpredictable Hedge Maze filled with food; players must navigate the maze to access a hidden area with even more food – but also more enemies the player must avoid or sneak past.
